<h1 id=stratohomes>strato.homes</h1><p>strato.homes is an exciting startup in a modular construction space that builds homes
in 3 months from the purchase to the move-in. A part of their vision is an AI
planner, that would create a floor-plan based on (1) buyer&rsquo;s choices and (2) engineering
restrictions imposed by their modular system.</p><p>We took on the challenge and built the PoC AI planner in 7 months. Our deliverable was
a floor-plan generation algorithm, a cloud infrastructure setup for high intensity
computations, a backend service and a user interface for the exploration of results. Our
algorithm is capable of generating plans for thousands of different configuration options.</p><p>Our solution was based on translations of the planner to linear programming and
constraint programming problems and solving them using coin-or and ortools solvers. We also
investigated reinforcement learning and conditional variational encoder based approaches
but found them unpractical.</p><p>The stack behind the is currently being developed futher, and we hope to see it
deployed soon!</p><ul>
